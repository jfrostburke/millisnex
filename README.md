Welcome to the project page for SNEx 2.0, an updated version of the [Supernova Exchange](https://supernova.exchange) built using the [TOM Toolkit](https://tomtoolkit.github.io/). To build your own TOM (Target Observation Manager), check out the [getting started guide](https://tomtoolkit.github.io/docs/getting_started).

The Supernova Exchange (2.0) is an interface for viewing and sharing observational
data of supernovae, and for requesting and managing observations
with the [LCO](https://lco.global/) network.

SNEx 2.0 is currently live at [test.supernova.exchange](https://test.supernova.exchange/). Most pages are private (proprietary data), but the "TNS Targets" page is public.
